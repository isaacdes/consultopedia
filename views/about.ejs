                            <p>While "NGO" has various interpretations, the term is generally accepted to include non-profit, private organizations that operate outside of government control. Some NGOs rely primarily on volunteers, while others support a paid staff. The World Bank identifies two broad groups of NGOs:

                              Operational NGOs, which focus on the design and implementation of development projects.
                              Advocacy NGOs, which defend or promote a specific cause and seek to influence public policy.
                              A major objective of our non-governmental organization (NGO) is welfare work in relation to helping people in get their work done.
